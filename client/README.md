## CRUD App

CRUD App is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack that allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a collection of items. It provides a powerful platform for managing and interacting with data.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
